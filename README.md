## Getting Started

This game is fully functional when launched. The user may place ships in any location they wish, but if they want to follow the rules, please place them either horizontally or vertically. Once the user places all of the ships, the guessing may begin!

## Next Steps

Here are the added functionalities future releases may include:
- Giving the computer vertical ship placements
- Checking the user's ship placements so they meet the rules
